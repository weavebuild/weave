# Lumina

Lumina is a cross-chain L1 blockchain designed for asynchronous and co-parallel DeFi. Revolutionizing high-fidelty tradeFi. Secure, feeless, decentralized and infinitely scalable.
 

## Technical Advancements

- **Lumina Spark**: In-house threaded transaction-engine providing the required scalability on cosmos-level. The usage of Lumina Spark will allow users to perform transactions with up to 8 tx-threads
- **Lumina Halo**: Secure hardware wallet with cold-staking functions and smart walletOS. Lumina Halo contributes to the security and stability of the entire ecosystem.  
- **Lumina Tsubaki**: A new smart-contract language based on a solidity-superset grammar, providing support for threaded contracts. Tsubaki contracts are compile-time formally-verified. Existing solidity code is valid Tsubaki code and can easily be deployed on Lumina.
- **Lumina Arc**:  Lumina Arc is the first sovereign decentralized identity system to be implemented on a cosmos sidechain. DIDs allow for easy interaction on the DeFi level.
- **Completely feeless**: Lumina is the first Layer-1 blockchain to enter the space with a completely feeless consensus. Lumina was designed for developers and users in mind that can not afford the liquidity used for gas-fees and others.  
- **Validator UBI**: We implement a contract-controlled universal basic income for validators and archive-nodes. This attracts validators to operate nodes for the Lumina ecosystem.
- **Transaction Queue**: To prevent DoS/dDos and sandwich attacks, Lumina features a built-in transaction queue that queues transactions based on their size, timestamp and suspicious activity.
- **Dual-token economy**: The entire Lumina ecosystem is controlled by a dual-token economy powered by $LSPT and $USDL. These two tokens act as the fore-most hearth of this ecosystem. $LSPT is the native token at L1 level. It is used to pay out UBI to the validators and is additionally used as a governance token. $USDL in the other hand is a algorithmic non-collateralized stablecoin pegged to $USD.
- **CCV and MEV protection**: 
- **No frontrunning**:
- **TAMM and TCLOB**: novel mechanism for threaded automated market making and CLOBs


> Note: Lumina Spark is still a canary draft. We are working to get a stable build of Spark on the canary testnet.
